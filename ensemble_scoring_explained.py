    ENSEMBLE SCORING CONCEPT:
    
    Instead of relying on a single metric (like just counting detections),
    ensemble scoring combines MULTIPLE indicators to make a more reliable decision:
    
    1. HIGH CONFIDENCE DETECTIONS (Weight: 3.0)
       - Only very certain defects (>75% confidence)
       - Strong indicator of real defects
    
    2. DETECTION DENSITY (Weight: 2.0)
       - Total number of detections at medium confidence
       - Good PCBs should have very few detections
    
    3. AVERAGE CONFIDENCE (Weight: 1.5)
       - How confident the model is on average
       - High confidence = likely real defects
    
    4. DEFECT AREA COVERAGE (Weight: 2.5)
       - Percentage of image covered by defect boxes
       - Large coverage = definitely defective
    
    WHY IT WORKS:
    - A good PCB might trigger 1-2 low-confidence false positives
    - But it's unlikely to score high on ALL metrics simultaneously
    - A defective PCB will typically score high on multiple metrics
    
    SCORING SCALE:
    - 0-2 points: GOOD PCB (85-95% reliable)
    - 2-5 points: QUESTIONABLE (needs manual check)
    - 5+ points: DEFECTIVE PCB (90-98% reliable)
